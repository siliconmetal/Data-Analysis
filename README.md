# Data-Analysis

The insights and trends that data analysis skills can help abridging information and 
prove to be very useful in making immediate as well as futuristic business and 
organizational decisions. 
This analysis aims to perform miscellaneous data analysis and 
data visualization operations using Python for eight globally renowned companies' 
equity(stock) prices and volume between the years 2012 and 2020. 

The project fairly covers concepts from Python libraries like: 
- NumPy, 
- Pandas, 
- Matplotlib,
- Scikit-learn, 
and core concepts of Machine Learning to perform Regression Analysis for a linear 
data model.

The project focuses on analyzing the tabular data and compare the various equities at 
different modules to abstract information like:
1. Which equity is been least volatile or showed leaser Price Fluctuation Range 
between the years 2012 to 2020,
2. Which equity is been highly volatile or showed the highest Price Fluctuation 
The range between the year 2012 to 2020,
3. Which equity/equities, a portfolio should have to depend upon its nature 
(Less risk but with lower returns, Higher risk but may give greater returns),
4. The market correlation concerning specific equity,
5. Visualizing correlation, normalized growth, and Price Fluctuation Range, and
6. Performing Ridge regression to trace volume growth between 2012 to 2020.
